Combustion:
C + O₂ → CO₂
Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water vapor: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

Metal-Acid Reactions:
Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂
Fe + 2HCl → FeCl₂ + H₂

Neutralization:
NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O

Rust Formation:
Fe + O₂ + H₂O → Fe₂O₃

Sulfur and Oxygen:
S + O₂ → SO₂

Sodium and Chlorine:
2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl

Copper and Sulfur:
Cu + S → CuS

Safety Notes:
- Hydrogen is flammable and forms explosive mixtures with air.
- Chlorine gas is toxic and should be handled with care.
- Neutralization reactions are exothermic.
- Combustion reactions release heat and light.
