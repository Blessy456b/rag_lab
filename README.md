# ðŸ§  Virtual Chemistry RAG Lab 
Welcome to  **RAG Lab**-   An interactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit, combining AI-assisted chemistry reasoning and a vector-based knowledge base.
Users can mix elements virtually, observe predicted reactions, and query a context-aware assistant that reasons using scientific text files stored locally.

## ðŸ§ª Overview

RAG Lab is built to help developers and researchers:
- Prototype and evaluate RAG systems efficiently.
- Integrate multiple vector databases and embedding models.
- Fine-tune prompt templates for domain-specific retrieval.
- Understand *why* each part of the RAG pipeline matters.

This project serves as both a **learning lab** and a **production-ready template**.
